# flask_bootstrap_example
This is a simple demonstration of flask_bootstrap

documentation @ https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Bootstrap/

In reality, this add-on doesn't bring in that much to Flask, except a predefined template and blocks from which
to pull the CDN resources into your project.  If you are looking for productivity and just "get sh-t done" look,
this is for you.

since bootstrap is wildly popular, you can find lots of examples/resources
for design inspiration-- you can override the default jquery based scripts
with something else (e.g. Angular)

One could just as easily used Materialize (inspired by Google's "Material Design") or Bulma (a pure CSS framework)
to which you can add your own flavor of javascript

You can get it here.
